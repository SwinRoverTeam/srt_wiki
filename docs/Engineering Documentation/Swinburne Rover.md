## Preface 
The Swinburne Rover team was assembled to compete in the Australian Rover Challenge conducted by Adelaide University. The challenge requires the designing, manufacturing and testing of a lunar rover with efficiency and effectiveness in mind. 

Various academic institutes worldwide will compete in this challenge, consolidating their engineering knowledge in numerous forms to maintain and improve their competitive edge. Ergo, this document was designed to capture the knowledge and technical details used and accrued by the members of the Swinburne Rover team.

When it comes to engineering any product, formal documentation is a requirement; having it will inform/guide existing and future team members. This document will consist of, in detail, all the knowledge, and best practices, and any technical specifications used in the engineering process of the lunar rover. 

Meaning this documentation will act as a sort of ‘bible’. Although optional, it might become necessary for any engineer working on the rover, especially as the physical rover gets increasingly complex. Hopefully, this document will serve you well.

On behalf of the rover team, we extend our deepest gratitude to those partaking in this arduous endeavour with us.

## Layout
Current layout structure:
- talk about what you are doing in your assigned role.
- show pictures of the things you are working on and developing.
- talk about the images in detail on what you did and why.
- sources: websites for part sourcing, GrabCAD models, data sheets, special diagrams, maybe special learning materials etc. Anything that could be useful for future team members and for yourself.
